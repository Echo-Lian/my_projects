This project aims to incorporate FSTs to create interactive exercises on the server terminal where learners can input a certain verb form, and the FST provides instant feedback, visualizing all inflections of the verb in lexical form. For example, the lexical form of the verb "to read" in past form (読んだ) should show in 読む+V+Cons+Plain+Past which indicates that the input is a consonant-stem verb in its past plain form. Also, learners can interact with these visualizations to explore the relationships between different verb forms and gain a clearer understanding of conjugation patterns by entering the lexical form of the verb.
